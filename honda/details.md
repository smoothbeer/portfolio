Honda HR-V Perfect Fit Garage
We were asked to pre-launch the new HR-V in social channels in order to drive requests for more information. The client’s brief was that the HR-V “fits perfectly into your life”.

Our insight was based on the fact that most people with garages never use them to house their car as they’re often a maelstrom of chaos and mess.

Our content exceeded targets by 20x, and pre-registration targets were exceeded by 16x.
