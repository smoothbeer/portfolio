OGs

The OGs is a series of 1,024 digital paintings that merge generative art, code, Al and digital painting to reimagine the world's most universal symbols, the emojis, as painterly digital relics. The series forms part of FAR's ongoing exploration of how contemporary image making bridges the painterly and the algorithmic.
Each work begins with a hand-drawn emoji, a gesture later manipulated by algorithms that distort, warp and rebuild it into a new visual form. The layering of techniques, from drawing to computation, complicates the image and transforms it into a hybrid digital painting.
We use emojis daily as part of our shared digital alphabet. The OGs treats them as cultural fossils, exploring how online symbols mutate over time while still carrying emotional charge.
Visually rooted in early web aesthetics and post-internet art, The OGs celebrates the imperfections of the digital age and its connection to painting culture.



I created the brand visual identity. Pretty simple, using emojis as the letter O from OGs. The project name is a play on OGs and Em-O-Gees.
