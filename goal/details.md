GOAL.COM

While at VICE Media Denmark, I worked on the rebrand of GOAL, one of the world’s biggest football media platforms. I helped shape the brand manifesto, tone of voice, and early art direction as part of a wider identity refresh.

Off the back of the project, I joined Footballco full-time to focus on content, developing concept for editorial frameworks, social formats, and storytelling systems.
