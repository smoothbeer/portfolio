Thingdoms is an experimental art project released in 2021 as a complete collection of 10,000 digital characters. It explores identity, mood, and narrative through character-based generative systems.
Conceived as a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk, it emerged during a moment shaped by generative art, blockchain, and internet culture, and lives across various mediums.

This is basically an NFT project I created with a friend in 2021. Was really sucessful. Was part of the NFT hype cycle. But at its core it really was/is a creative project that experimented with tech/art/code/community.

What isn't described here is that obviusly at its core is an art collection. 10k. characters. over time i have reimagined these characters and released additional 10k collections, so each thing is reimagined in a new style. ive done a pixel version, a floaty version, a remastered version, and might do more.

Beyond that, i think what's really interesting is im exploring stuff like world building, non linear story telling, non linear world building, and essentially have created a creative sandbox for myself to explore these (any fields). also, i'm really interested in how ai is going to affect storytelling and ip ssystems and im exploring how i can set up thingdoms to be ready for that world. we dont need to say all this i just think the context might be useful to you. 


there's also 10k of each version so advise on the best way to display this. we also have a thingdoms.com, it's own website, but its not currently live.

i'm also interested if i should display thingdoms as a single piece of work, overview the versions in the concept, but then also display the different versions as standalone pieces because they were made at a later date and have their own inspirations etc and are 10k bodies of work on their own depsite sharing a metadata
