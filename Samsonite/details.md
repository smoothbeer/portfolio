Directing BTS content for Samsonite.

Agency: RANKIN / The Full Service
Creative: Lukeabc


Not really sure about this one. At rankin i was tasked with leading the bts team capturing content for the samsonite shoot as a creative. but in reality i didnt need to do much. the video guys know what they're doing. the editors just put together a bread and butter bts film and while i did feed back on it is has no narative etc.
