This is part of a larger unification project that is not public so we will probably have to redact the project name or just frame it differently.

Essentially I was tasked by an artist (FAR) to help him unify a load of his art projects under a new project name (this is probably the bit we don't mention) but also to unify it all under a consistent brand.

Each project is vastly different in terms of its visual style, however there are a lot of shared elements like his use of fibrant colour, abstract form (read up more on FAR: FAR (Francisco Alarcón, New York, NY) is an artist whose practice bridges digital culture and the visual arts. His work explores the technical specificity of post-photographic image production and its role in contemporary visual culture, as well as the shifting dynamics of content distribution in the age of digital networks—from cinema to social media to blockchain. Approaching digital imaging from historical, cultural, and conceptual perspectives, Alarcón seeks to demystify both the technical processes and the philosophical frameworks underlying media operations.

He holds an MA from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and an MArch from the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), and previously pursued doctoral studies in Film and Visual Studies / Critical Media Practice at Harvard University. He is also a licensed Civil Engineer (PE).

Alarcón has taught at Harvard University, MIT, and Boston University, and has lectured at institutions including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His work has been exhibited internationally, with presentations at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, Ars Electronica, and the Schinkel Pavillon, among others.)

What I decided to to was to essentially create a format that allowed him/me to take cross sections of his work, then apply a blur to them to create an even more abstract form. This form was then used as a background for a unique wordmark for each project (we laid out examples of these word marks and im happy to present them, but im not sure they ever went live, but essentially i presented a visual treatment that allowed his work to be unified.)

Also each wordmark would work as a mono wordmark. 

Examples of the visuals are in the doc too. 


Made March 2024



Notes;

Our challenge is to rationalise these individual collections into a singular body of work, and unify them by creating a key visual/word mark for each collection – as well as doing the same for the collective body of work, PARALLAX ISLAND.

USING A DIFFERENT FONT BUT THE SAME VISUAL MECHANISM (THE BLUR) TO CREATE A UNIQUE WORDMARK WITH CONSISTENT ART DIRECTION ACROSS ALL COLLECTIONS.
