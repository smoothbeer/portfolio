DENTSU MCGARRYBOWEN
DAZN

I was part of the core creative team that launched Raw Sport, DAZN’s new global platform. Working across concept, campaigns, and content, I helped shape the brand’s tone, look, and energy, bringing the raw emotional edge of sport into everything from fight promos to platform idents.

Introducing 'Raw Sport'
Dazn, the global sports streaming channel connecting fans to unfiltered sport.

DAZN is the world’s fastest-growing sports streaming platform. Hired by Angus Macadam as Creative Director, Joe’s role was to create and launch a new global platform, Raw Sport The mission was clear: Establish DAZN by bringing fans closer to the grit and power of sport.

The idea of stripping sport back to its raw, emotional core shaped every part of the channel, beyond just advertising – from the look and naming of programming content to the choice of platform ambassadors.

In this fast-paced role, Joe built a team, defined processes, delivered campaigns, and directed shoots with top-tier talent worldwide. The team including editors, designers, producers, animators and creatives, produced 360 degree content including broadcast, social and OOH.



A unified design system that spreads the raw power of sport.
The art direction, developed with the DAZN in-house team and the Dentsu team, was implemented across various touchpoints, such as social media, broadcast, out-of-home, and print.

Our visual identity enabled DAZN to tell provocative and engaging stories, aligned with the brand’s personality, regardless of the country or type of asset needed.

An account as action-packed as the channel. In a week, the team would be working on everything from Premier League season starts to fight promos to idents and outdoor, creating work for global markets.

DAZN in-house Creative Directors Toby and Stu, Dentsu CD’s Angus Macadam and Joe Koprowski.
