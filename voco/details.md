I spent a couple of months working on various project at JWT London. 

At the time I arrived, Voco was in it's infancy. With only half a hotel to it's name, their business model was to find interesting individual hotels and convert them into a voco. 

Thus 'Stay Interesting' was born. 

For each new hotel launch we discovered unique stories, facts and objects and used these to promote the opening. Combined with the Voco branding, we used close ups of the Voco logos to create a unique look that brought these incredible stories to life.




I think this project is cool, but I think it needs to be framed more about how we created a format that identified unique, interesting things/facts about the hotel or surrounding area. Generally voco hotels are hotels that already exist that they've bought, or they've been established in existing property with history (we cant say this but we can allude to it). We essentially created a format that looked for these quirky details and paired them with striking visuals. 



voco means ‘to invite’ and ‘call together’, originating from Latin – representing our thoughtful, unstuffy and charming nature. While the destinations celebrate the individualism of each hotel and location, they are united by voco’s unique character and style. Embrace the local feel, personal touches and laid-back attitude to create moments you’ll remember long after checkout.

voco is proud to be the winner of the World Travel Awards for Europe’s Leading Premium Hotel Brand, the Middle East’s Leading Premium Hotel Brand and the World’s Leading Premium Hotel Brand 2025, for five consecutive years.​

voco operates in key destinations across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, Greater China and other international markets, serving both leisure and business travellers with accessible, premium stays.


When we first started work on this campaign, voco was in its infancy – with only half a hotel – but their business model is to find interesting individual hotels and convert them to a voco. As such, we developed a campaign based on the idea of ‘stay interesting’. For each new hotel launch we discovered unique stories, facts and objects and used these to promote the opening. This drove the whole ethos of the campaign and everything was done with the idea of ‘interesting’ behind it. Finding out that you can exchange your reward points for a hedge trimmer for example.

voco select properties for their interesting features, so it made sense to put these at the heart of the campaign: each hotel launch was built around unique stories and facts about the location. Bold and unexpected visuals make the brand stand out in a marketplace full of expected luxury cues.
