When I lived in NYC in 2016 I hung around in a basement of a sunglasses shop in Soho that was home to the 8 Ball Community https://8ballcommunity.club/

We are a collective that produces art, publishes media and creates opportunities to share cultural programming.
We exist to promote educational exchange, cultural growth and contribute to media autonomy.
We are a base for people of all identities and backgrounds to come together, collaborate, create and learn.

What is 8 Ball Community?
An artist collective; a community space; an independent media platform; a public library; a publishing house; a center for practical education.

Who is 8 Ball Community?
Run by volunteers, 8 Ball Crew is made of creative minds of all ages, backgrounds, gender and gender non conforming.

What does 8 Ball Community do?
We broadcast radio and tv shows, made by volunteers and anyone else who needs the platform. The TV acts as public access, so anyone can drop off their videos or come and use the studio.
We publish zine and small books of artists we think deserve to be highlighted, as well as informative zines about various activism subjects.
We collect zines and make them accessible to the public during our opening hours.
We organize events, including book fairs, exhibitions, screenings, dance parties, conferences, and more.
We produce workshops on various subjects open to the public or for specific organizations.
We create connections between people to build a strong, independent community of creative minds.


Come visit us!
We are open Sundays 1-5pm, at 1 E Broadway *

I wasn't there long but I made a Zine to learn the act of making zines and to contribute. 

Created at 8-Ball Zines—a transient collective of artists and publishers experimenting with DIY print culture in NYC. I created a lo-fi zine archiving Kanye West’s tweets—part absurd artefact, part accidental time capsule.

This was pre crazy kanye. Right around the Pablo release actually. 2016.
